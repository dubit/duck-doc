# duck-doc
A markdown documentation generator for duck packages

# Setup
Clone the repository and open .sln in your favourite IDE (JetBrains Rider is preferred).

The solution contains 2 projects:

## documentation-generator
This project is a .net console application project. It builds a command line app that takes in xml files and assemblies generated by c# code. The project can be built, and the cli tool can be used. Alternatively there is a run configuration integrated with the other embedded project.

## sources
This is a unity library project, that builds a unity compatible .dll. It's also configured to output the documentation to an xml file. Both into the build directory (/bin/Debug). The xml and the dll can both be used by the documentation-generator
